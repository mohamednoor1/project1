            <h3>here are the answers to a few frequently asked questions about introduction algorithms </h3>
            <p><i>will there be a fourth edition?if so,when will it be available</i></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 40px;" >the fourth edition, we maintain an <a href="#">errta page</a>that allow you to list the error by date, by page,by serverity, or by discover.</p>
            <p>There is even an incremental update feature, allowing you to list the errors posted since the last date that you asked about.we stopped our logging errors for the third edition in january 2019 that we could focus on preparing the fouth edition.</p>
            <p> <i>How do i report errors?</i>First please visit the <a href="#">errta page</a>to verify that te error has not been reported already.once you have determined that you have found ann unreported error, send emai to <a href="#">clrs-bugs@mit.edu</a>we will respond as quickly as possible,often with a day</p>
            <p>pleas use the <a href="#">clrs-bugs@mitu.edu</a>address only to report errors.if you have a sugession , please contact me directly at <a href="#">the@cs.dartmouth .edu</a></p>
             <p><i>Do you correct errors</i>
            yes, each time a new printing is produced, it contain all correction to all errors it have been reported by that time. The <a href="#">errta page </a>indicate in which each error was corrected</p> <p> <i>what is the diffrence between an edition and printing</i>
                    Each edition is a major revision of the book. The first edition of Introduction to Algorithms was published in 1990, the second edition came out in 2001, the third edition appeared in 2009, and the fourth edition is from 2022. A printing for a given edition occurs when the publisher needs to manufacture more copies. As the answer to the previous question indicates, we have been correcting errors in each printing of the second and third editions. We perturb the pagination as little as possible when correcting errors for a new printing.</p>
                    <p> <i>can iget solution and exercise and problems.</i>
                        As of third edition we are makiingb available solution for a select set of exercise and problems.They are posted at the MIT press website</p>
                        <p>We have introduced an instructors's manual, which is only available to the instructors who have adopted the book for course use.The manual has lecture notes and solution to aditional exercise and problems, but by no means all of them.(i estimate that writting up of solution to all exercise and problems would take some how between 2000 and 3000 pages.)you'll need to contact MIT press for passwords to access the manual site and the files.(contact information is at the MIT press website.)You cannot get the password from me or any of my cauothors.</p>
                        <h4>i will not respond to request for the manual or solutions</h4>
                        <p> <i>how can i typeset pseudocode to make it look like the pseudocode in the book?</i>i created three packages for laTe2e the clrscode package gives you pseudocode in the style of second edition, the clrscode3e package gives you pseudocode in the style of the third edition, and the clrscode4e packages give pseudocode in the style of fourth edition.
                            <br>
                            You can download the clrscode4e package <i>here</i>and its documentation <i>here</i></p>
                            <br>
                            You can download with either clrscode or clrscode3e and its documentation by clicking <i>here</i>
                             <p> <i>can you send me free copy of the book?.can send me an electric copy of the book? Can you help me with algorithms problems i have?</i>
                            No, no and sorry,but no.You can purchase an electric copy of the book, however : Amazon.com now sends a version of <i>introdoction to algorithms</i>for kindle</p>
                            
                            <p> <i>i see that they are two version of edition,one published by the MIT press and one published by Mcgrew hall-hill. How do the two versions differ</i>
                                <br>
                            Other minor diffrent in the covers, the book content in the two version is identical. Mcgraw-Hall also includes a CD (See the next questions</p>
                            <p> <i>Are algorithms in the book implemented in real programing language. rurther than just pseuducode?</i>
                                In the second edition, McGraw-Hill included with the book a CD containing Java implementations of all the algorithms in Parts I-VI. The CD also has Javadoc-generated web pages that document all the classes. We did not update the Java implementations for the third edition.</p>
                                <p>For the fourth edition, we have made available on the MIT Press website  <a href="#">implementations in Python</a>   by Linda Xiao and me.</p>

                                <p> <i>Algorithms Unlocked</i>  is a gentler, less technical, entry  into algorithms than  <i>Introduction to Algorithms.</i>  It contains some mathematics, but not nearly as deep as in Introduction to Algorithms. The Amazon site for the book is <a href="#">here,</a>  and the MIT Press site is here.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>I maintain an <a href="#">errata page</a>  for <i>Algorithms Unlocked.</i>  If you find an error in the book and it's not already in the <a href="#">errata page,</a>  send email to a <a href="#">algorithms-unlocked@mit</a> .edu. (The email address in the preface of the book is incorrectâ€”the first known error in the book.)</p>
                                <p><i>Algorithms Unlocked</i>  is the <a href="3">10,000th book title published by MIT Press.</a> </p>
